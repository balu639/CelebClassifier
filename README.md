## Introduction

CelebClassifier is a machine learning project aimed at celebrity image classification. The project utilizes Haar Cascade for facial feature detection and OpenCV for image processing. The goal is to accurately identify famous faces in images.

## Methodology

### Data Collection and Preprocessing

- **Dataset**: We collected a diverse dataset containing images of various celebrities.
- **Preprocessing**: Images were preprocessed to ensure uniformity in size and format.

### Feature Extraction

- **Haar Cascade**: Used for facial feature detection to extract relevant features from images.
- **OpenCV**: Leveraged for additional image processing and feature extraction tasks.

### Model Selection and Training

- **Models**: Experimented with Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest classifiers.
- **Training**: Models were trained on the preprocessed dataset using a variety of parameters and hyperparameters.

### Evaluation and Deployment

- **Evaluation**: Models were evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Deployment**: The model with the highest accuracy was selected for deployment.

## Results

- **Logistic Regression**: Accuracy - 88%.
- **SVM**: Accuracy - 85%.
- **Random Forest**: Accuracy - 68%.

## Conclusion

- LogisticRegression outperformed other models with the highest accuracy.
- CelebSpotter demonstrates effective celebrity image classification using machine learning techniques.
- Further optimization and fine-tuning can enhance the model's performance.
